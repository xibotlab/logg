# Logg
Logg is the social network service from Moonlab.
Logg is similar to Twitter, but it's good for logging something.

## Installing Code
Before starting, install Python 3. Logg uses Python Flask, the web framework.
Just install Python 3 in <a href="https://python.org" target="_blank">Python homepage</a>

After installing Python3, enter this in terminal:
```
pip install flask
```
This command will install Flask, the web framework.

After installing Flask, finally you can download source code and run.
The easiest way is to go to your work directory and enter this:
```
git clone https://github.com/xibotlab/logg.git
```
This command will copy the repository and save it into your directory.

After copying source code, run app.py.
Than go to localhost:5000.
